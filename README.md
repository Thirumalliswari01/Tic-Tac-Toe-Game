# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game


## Description
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Java. The game allows a human player to compete against an AI player, providing an engaging and interactive experience within the console.

## Features
- **Player Modes**: Play against an AI opponent.
- **Game Board**: A visually represented 3x3 grid for players to take turns placing their marks.
- **Win/Draw Detection**: Automatically checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, or diagonals) and detects a draw if the grid is full without a winner.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players enter valid row and column values for each move.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI randomly selects valid moves during its turn.
