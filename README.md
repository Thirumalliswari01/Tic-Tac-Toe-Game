# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game


## Description
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Java. The game allows a human player to compete against an AI player, providing an engaging and interactive experience within the console.

## Features
- **Player Modes**: Play against an AI opponent.
- **Game Board**: A visually represented 3x3 grid for players to take turns placing their marks.
- **Win/Draw Detection**: Automatically checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, or diagonals) and detects a draw if the grid is full without a winner.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players enter valid row and column values for each move.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI randomly selects valid moves during its turn.

## Files
- `TicTacToe.java`: Contains the logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, including the game board, win/draw checks, and input validation.
- `Player.java`: Defines the abstract Player class used by both Human and AI players.
- `HumanPlayer.java`: Implements the logic for the human player's moves.
- `AIPlayer.java`: Implements the logic for the AI player's moves.
- `LaunchGame.java`: The main class that initiates the game and controls the flow of the game.

## How to Run the Game
Follow these steps to run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thirumalliswari01/TicTacToe-Java.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ``` bash
    cd C:\Users\THIRU\OneDrive\Desktop\git\Tic-Tac-Toe-Game\TicTacToe\src
3.**Compile the Java Files:**
     ``bash
     javac LaunchGame.java
4. **Run the Game:**
  `bash
  java LaunchGame

## Future Improvements
Two Human Players: Add an option to allow two human players to compete.
Smarter AI: Implement a more strategic AI that can avoid obvious losing moves or make better predictions.
GUI: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game instead of console-based interaction.
Game Modes: Add more options like difficulty levels for the AI or alternative grid sizes.
## Notes
This is a simple console-based game that you can enhance or modify further to add more features or improve the user experience. Ensure all necessary Java files are in the same directory before compiling and running the game.
